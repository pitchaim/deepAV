Design:
-------

Input module:
    Audio classification system
    - MFCC extraction from audio samples
    - Semi-deep convolutional net learning MFCCs to categories
    - Pre-trained vision net
    - Shallow net learning audio - image features
   [- future: generative network to reconstruct image predictions for unseen sounds]

Experiment (need to disentangle):
---------------------------------

    Train system for 3 categories (represented as 3-unit 1-hot vector): happy, sad, neutral
    Categorize [1000] sound samples as happy, sad, or neutral, and choose images accordingly.
    Extract MFCCs from all sound samples. Convolve over MFCC features as matrices (i.e. no frequency windowing or sequential dependency, e.g. LSTM)
    to learn category membership, with [400]-dimensional layer as feature learning target, followed by
    3-unit penultimate layer and softmax layer for category membership targets.
    Run k-fold cross-validation for train/test robustness on held-out examples.
    Run images through pre-trained network (e.g. AlexNet on ImageNet), extract features from penultimate layer projections.
    Set up shallow network to learn mappings from audio features to image features.
    Run k-fold cross-validation on held-out examples.
    Pipe in new sounds and see what happens!
